# Kingdom Quest block

## Status

**IN PROGRESS** on branch `nextgen-step15-kingdom-quests`.

This block starts from the merged Quest runtime baseline. Normal Quest behavior
must remain closed and CI-green while Kingdom Quest work proceeds separately.

## Project-source evidence already available

The repository already contains source-faithful SQL exports for:

- `KQTeam.shn` — 8 rows with team/PvP/division and red/blue regeneration coordinates;
- `KQIsVote.shn` — per-KQ vote enable flags;
- `KQVoteDesc.shn` — four vote reasons;
- `KQVoteMajorityRate.shn` — 70/50 percent thresholds;
- `KingdomQuestDesc.shn` — 39 description rows.

The project documentation also contains real NA2016 packet-capture evidence for:

- World-side KQ list traffic (SH22 type 29);
- instance detail request/response (CH22 type 3 / SH22 type 4);
- registration (CH22 type 5 plus SH22 type 6/50 responses);
- recruitment/countdown broadcasts (SH22 types 11, 30, 31, 37, 38);
- temporary Zone transfer into a real KQ instance;
- a complete failed Lost Mini Dragon session;
- empty `KingdomQuestFailed` packet (SH22 type 19);
- the observed dead-player return-to-town edge case.

No packet field or scheduler rule is to be invented from names alone.

## First implementation slice

World `DataProvider` now loads the source-faithful static KQ metadata:

- `KingdomQuestTeams`;
- `KingdomQuestVoteEnabled`;
- `KingdomQuestVoteReasons`;
- `KingdomQuestVoteMajorityRates`.

This deliberately does **not** replace the current zero-KQ list response yet.
The next step is to import/correlate the authoritative KingdomQuest definition
and schedule data from the project sources, then reproduce the captured SH22
list entry layout before enabling live registration.

## Guardrails

1. KQ definitions/schedules come from project source data, not hard-coded
   recreation from description text.
2. Captured packet fields are reproduced only after byte-level correlation.
3. Temporary Zone allocation and transfer use the existing World->Zone
   architecture; no fixed port is inferred from captures.
4. Vote-kick behavior stays disabled until a real KQ session state exists.
5. Normal Quest code remains untouched unless a proven shared primitive is
   required.
